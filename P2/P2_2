1) It is convenient to represent the change in expression for each gene in each experiment as a log2 ratio because the results of many DNA microarray experiments are
fluorescent ratios. As such, ratio measurements are best processed in log space. For example, if you are looking at gene expression over time, and the results are relative expression levels as compared to time 0. If we consider that at timepoint 1, a gene is unchanged, at timepoint 2 it is up 2-fold, and at timepoint 3 it is down 2-fold (relative to time 0). Then, the raw values are 1.0, 2.0, and 0.5 respectively. However, we want to think of 2-fold up and 2-fold down as the same magnitude of change, just in an opposite direction. In log space, the data points become 0, 1.0, and -1.0, meaning the 2-fold up and down are symmetric about 0. If we were to use the raw ratios of these timepoints, on the other hand, we would think that a 2-fold up change was twice as significant as a 2-fold down change, which is not what we want. 

2) XCluster allows you to use a Pearson correlation (as the default) or a Euclidean distance to calculate pairwise distances between genes' vectors. First and foremost, Euclidean distance is sensitive to scaling and differences in average expression level, whereas correlation is not. Thus, for log2 ratio transformed data,  Euclidean distance  may be used when we consider genes to be close to one another either when they go up and down together, or in opposition (i.e. wherever one gene overexpresses, the other gene underexpresses and vice versa). If Euclidean distance is chosen to cluster samples, then observations with high values will be clustered together, and likewise observations with low values will be clustered together. Pearson correlation, on the other hand, is better when applied to non-ratio-style data.
